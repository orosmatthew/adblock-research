abstract = {Ad blockers are a formidable threat to the vitality of the online advertising eco-system. Understanding their prevalence and impact is challenging due to the massive scale and diversity of the eco-system. In this paper, we utilize unique data gathering assets to assess the prevalence and impact of ad blockers from an Internet-wide perspective. Our study is based on (i) a 2 million person world-wide user panel that provides ground truth for ad blocker installations and (ii) telemetry from large number of publisher web pages and ads served to publishers. We describe a novel method for assessing the prevalence of ad blocker installations that is based on Mixture Proportion Estimation. We apply this method to nearly 2 trillion web transactions collected over the period of 1 month (February 2016), to derive ad blocker prevalence estimates for desktop systems in diverse geographic areas and for diverse demographic groups. Next, using deployment estimates we consider the impact of ad blockers on users and on publisher sites. Specifically, we report on the reduction of ads shown to users with ad blockers installed and show that even though a user may have an ad blocker installed, they are still exposed to a significant number of ads. We also characterize the impact of ad blockers across different categories of publisher sites including those that may be participating in whitelisting.},

abstract = {Many internet ventures rely on advertising for their revenue. However, users feel discontent by the presence of ads on the websites they visit, as the data-size of ads is often comparable to that of the actual content. This has an impact not only on the loading time of webpages, but also on the internet bill of the user in some cases. In absence of a mutually-agreed procedure for opting out of advertisements, many users resort to ad-blocking browser-extensions.In this work, we study the performance of popular ad-blockers on a large set of news websites. Moreover, we investigate the benefits of ad-blockers on user privacy as well as the mechanisms used by websites to counter them. Finally, we explore the traffic overhead due to the ad-blockers themselves.},

abstract = {Ad blockers heavily rely on filter lists to block ad domains, which can serve advertisements and trackers. However, recent research has reported that some advertisers keep registering replica ad domains (RAD domains)—new domains that serve the same purpose as the original ones—which tend to slip through ad-blocker filter lists. Although this phenomenon might negatively affect ad blockers’ effectiveness, no study to date has thoroughly investigated its prevalence and the issues caused by RAD domains. In this work, we proposed methods to discover RAD domains and categorized their change patterns. From a crawl of 50,000 websites, we identified 1,748 unique RAD domains, 1,096 of which survived for an average of 410.5 days before they were blocked; the rest have not been blocked as of February 2021. Notably, we found that non-blocked RAD domains could extend the timespan of ad or tracker distribution by more than two years. Our analysis further revealed a taxonomy of four techniques used to create RAD domains, including two less-studied ones. Additionally, we discovered that the RAD domains affected 10.2\% of the websites we crawled, and 23.7\% of the RAD domains exhibiting privacy-intrusive behaviors, undermining ad blockers’ privacy protection.},
